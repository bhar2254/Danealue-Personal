    $pageInfo[postTeaser]="Star Wars is the entry level nerdy sci-fi movie that everyone 
    						needs to watch at least once in their lifetime. It is also 
    						the basis of almost everything that I do in the nerd/geek 
    						community. No, I'm not obsessed with Star Wars, but it was my 
    						first geeky experience.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="I watched Star Wars and was quite the fan of it for sometime, but 
							there came a time where the Star Wars universe was not enough 
							to quench the every-growing thirst that is nerdaism (a real religion (not really)). 
							I then moved on to normal everyday things, such as watching 
							Star Trek, Doctor Who, and everything else I could get my hands 
							on. As time continued I got geekier and geekier. Eventually I 
							decided to make a blog.
						</br></br>
							Without Star Wars you would not be at this URL.

							Thank you Star Wars. Not Lucas. You sold it to Disney.";
