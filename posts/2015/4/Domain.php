   							This means that everyone who uses this site will have to continue to 
   							use the very long and boring string of numbers that they used to get 
   							here. I'll explain once you open the full post.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="To purchase a domain you need to aquire at least $12. Depending on who 
   						you use to host the site and what the site url is that you choose. Now, 
   						for a normal person a $12/year fee wouldn't seem to bad, unless you 
   						have no credit/debit card. I am in this position. I don't have any 
   						form of internet money, and that makes it very difficult for me to 
   						be able to purchase a domain. That means that until I can find money 
   						everyone will have to use this IP.

   						Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll get this remedied as soon as possible.";
