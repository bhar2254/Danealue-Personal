							so that I can cut down the large number of lines of code from a 
							large amount of redundant lines to only the required lines of code 
							(e.g. the text in this post). As I move forward in this I think 
							that I can take my website from a very difficult to modify peace 
							of redundancy to a nice and easy to modify program.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="The only problem which I am currently faced with is the fact that I
   							can't seem to think of a way to connect the index page and this 
   							current page. If I could have a single file then all I would have 
   							to do is make this file and everything would be so seamless. All 
   							I need is java, or JavaScript. I'll look into it...";
