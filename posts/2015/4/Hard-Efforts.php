							that it'll probably best to integrate my Java application with a 
							bash script to be able to update my web site to the greatest 
							of my ability. Alas, this is going to take a slight amount of 
							work on my part. Oh, and I update Ampache some more too.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="I make sure that I keep Ampache updated and I listen to the form updates. 
   							Though my Ampache service is a very private service and not actually 
   							a public service I am very much open to suggestions. Moving on, 
   							I've spent quite some time and effort (most of today) working 
   							on keeping this whole thing up to date. It's been a large pain in 
   							my bum to keep this updated and to continue making it better and better. 
   						</br></br>
   							With every day I push many new updates. The biggest of yesterday 
   							(today depending on how when you decide the day starts) was the 
   							integration with multiple social sources (e.g. Twitter and Google+) 
   							trying to make this more usable. I've even added comments. Feel 
   							free to comment on this. Do it. C'mon guys.";
