						and I've decided that it's all coming along very well. I've gotten 
						around one thousand (only 2.5GB) of music loaded onto the server, but 
						alas my file management and my redundancy makes it almost 15GB. Only a 
						lot more than before. This is great, but it means if I'm going to 
						add any more music to the library I need to modify some files.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="It took quite some time, but all of my files eventually got added 
						to the server and I got all of the files in a good order, with all 
						of their information the way that they need to be. Looking forward 
						to more updates.";
