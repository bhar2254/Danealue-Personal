							to add to this site. I've very much a proponent of people sending me
							tweets and trying to help me out with my work. It's very helpful.";
	$pageInfo[postText]="In other news... I've also added a lot of updates. One of the biggest 
   							updates is the fact that I'm hosting my own server. Go to <a href=http://108.226.52.251>108.226.52.251</a> 
   							and you can check out my personal version of this site. It's still 
   							behind this site in terms of updating because I use this one 
   							to test it, simply because Red Hat is a vast amount easier to use 
   							than my own personal Ubuntu server. Check it out.
   						</br></br>UPDATE: I've also added a Goggle Comments widget. Feel free 
   							to comment on a page, but if you comment profanity I will remove 
   							the comments. Don't be stupid.";
